# Ignore github upstream docs because they give 403 even though the page exists.
# Sadly there is no way to tell this tool to treat 403 as "OK". But, it appears
# that these URLs can be checked with curl and its "--compressed" flag. So, we
# have to write a script that checks all such URLs separately with curl.
