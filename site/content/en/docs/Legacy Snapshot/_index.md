## Legacy Snapshot

Due to historical reasons, almost all of Prow's documentation resides in the
[kubernetes/test-infra][k/t-i] ("k/t-i") repo. As part of the [migration
effort](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prow/issues/4), this page captures
Prow documentation in the [k/t-i][] repository as of [October
25,
2022](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/ad35c59116f550a260de4fed95438fb43188ff1a).
All Markdown files have been copied in along with their directory structure
here.

## How you can help

The files in this snapshot should probably be reorganized around logical
delineations, and not the (inherited) filesystem delineations from [k/t-i][].
This is an ongoing effort and the goal is to one day delete this snapshot
altogether (to be replaced by equivalent documentation outside of this folder).
