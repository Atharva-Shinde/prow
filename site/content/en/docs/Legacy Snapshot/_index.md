## Legacy Snapshot

Due to historical reasons, almost all of Prow's documentation resides in the
[kubernetes/test-infra](k/t-i) repo. As part of the [migration
effort](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prow/issues/4), this page captures
Prow documentation in the [kubernetes/test-infra](k/t-i) repository as of [October
25,
2022](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/ad35c59116f550a260de4fed95438fb43188ff1a).
All Markdown files have been copied in along with their directory structure
here.
